In Dog Day, the players control a dog and interact with the world around it.
As the dog, the players may explore the world to learn more about it or simply
just do nothing. The history of the world is learned through the notes and books
scattered around the town and buildings. The players' health will slowly decrease
over time, eventually leading to the dog's death. In one room, there are multiple
crates in which the players can move to get to the seed. Once the player
get the seed, they must plant it in the patch of grass to "win". However, there 
are no real win conditions.
